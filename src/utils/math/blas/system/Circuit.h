* The circuit is represented by a system of linear equations Ax = b, where A is the resistance matrix,
* x is the current vector, and b is the voltage vector.
*
* @tparam T The data type of the elements in the circuit (e.g., double for real-valued resistances, currents, and
* voltages).
* @param n The size of the circuit (i.e., the number of resistances/currents/voltages).
* @param[out] A The resistance matrix of the circuit, which is made to be (barely) diagonally dominant.
* @param[out] b The voltage vector of the circuit, computed as the product of the resistance matrix and the current
* vector.
* @param[out] x The current vector of the circuit, randomly generated.
* @param seed The seed for the random number generator (default is 372).
*
* @note The resistances are randomly generated in the range [1, 10e3] 立.
* The currents are randomly generated in the range [-5, 5] Amperes.
* The function will print a warning message to the standard error stream if it cannot make the resistance matrix
* diagonally dominant.
